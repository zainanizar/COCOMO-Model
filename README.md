<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project aims to develop a hybrid model for effort estimation which is more
suitable than the existing algorithms. The algorithm explored is based on Boehm’s
COCOMO Model (Cost Constructive Model).
To validate the hybrid model, a cross-validation method must be utilized. Using
different datasets, we test the model’s performance. Failing to do this risks making
a claim about the performance that will not generalise well to the actual
performance in the real world.
